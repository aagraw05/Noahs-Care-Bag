            <h1 style="text-align: center;">About Noah</h1>
            <p class="story"> Noah Satterlee was a 12 year old boy diagnosed with a primary
                immunodeficiency
                among many other
                things whose illnesses
                were causing him to miss his 6th grade year. It was also the year for him to begin studying for
                his Bar Mitzvah and
                thinking of a mitzvah (good deed) project that he could do. <br /><br />
                Noah had been in and out of the hospital many, many
                times, not just locally,
                but also sent out of state. He had seen his parents struggling to get supplies together last
                minute or having to leave
                him to get necessary things like a toothbrush or shampoo. Noah also realized that not everyone
                has two parents, one to
                stay at the hospital and one to get needed items, nor does everyone have the time before being
                rushed to a hospital. He
                also saw the stress that his parents were under trying to care for him. This is when the idea
                for Noah’s Care Bags was
                born. Noah wanted to put together a little bag with travel sized toiletries, some candy (because
                chocolate makes
                everything better), and a message letting families know that they aren’t alone with their
                struggle.
                <br /><br />

                Noah had learned that even though he has his struggles, that there are others who may be
                struggling more. He realized
                that he can make a difference in this world even though he is “just a kid.” One of his favorite
                quotes is “Stars can’t
                shine without darkness.”

                Noah asked family and friends if they had toiletries to donate so he could make 100 bags to
                donate to Upstate Golisano
                Children’s Hospital in Syracuse NY. He collected enough for almost 200 bags! <br /><br />That's when he
                decided he wanted to keep
                collecting and donating. Noah’s Care Bags has helped over 1,000 families in three states so far.
                (Check out our map
                showing where we have donated!) Any items donated that don’t fit in the bags were donated to the
                Ronald McDonald House
                to help families that have to stay close to their child.<br /><br />

                <p>"I have been in and out of the hospital many times and have seen first hand how hard it is
                    for parents/guardians to take care of themselves when all they are worried about is their child.
                    I hope
                    to make it a little bit easier for them by providing toiletries, a snack and positive message.
